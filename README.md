Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am Ajesh Sharma (online alias AjeshCasual, also associated with ACasual), a passionate builder and researcher specializing in simulation and reinforcement learning model training. My core focus is on designing and experimenting with complex RL environments, pushing the boundaries of how agents learn and adapt. Alongside this, I enjoy creating small, everyday tools - lightweight utilities that simplify unnoticed tasks and bring automation into daily life.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML).
Here are some of my projects that I am currently working on:

  </h3>
     <p><sub><em>Work in Progress</em></sub></p>


      
  <p>
    Neural Nautilus is a multi‑agent framework modeling intelligent aquatic behavior in dynamic 3D environments. By combining reinforcement learning mentor agents with schooling and social learning dynamics, it captures emergent coordination among marine agents navigating procedurally generated terrains. The system leverages MAPPO for decentralized intelligence, 3D Perlin noise for terrain generation, and GPU‑accelerated tensors for performance.

  </h3>
  <p>
    A project that blends models with something unexpected…  
    Think simulation, transformation, and a touch of automation.  
    <br><br>
    🔒 Details are under wraps, but it’s designed to change how we look at data.
